Zoro is a command-line tool for encryption, decryption, hashing, and RSA key management written in Go. It provides a simple interface for users to secure their data and manage cryptographic keys efficiently.

## Introduction

Zoro is a versatile command-line tool designed for various cryptographic operations, including encryption, decryption, hashing, and RSA key management. Developed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, Zoro offers a user-friendly interface for securing sensitive data and managing cryptographic keys effectively.

## Features

- **AES Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt files or strings using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm.
- **Hashing Algorithms**: Compute hashes of values using popular hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and MD5.
- **RSA Key Generation**: Generate RSA key pairs of custom bit lengths and optionally save them to a database for secure key management.
- **Database Integration**: Store and manage RSA keys in a database, providing centralized access control and key retrieval.
